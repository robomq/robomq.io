## RoboMQ In Action: ADP to AD Integration Solution

<a href="https://www.robomq.io/">RoboMQ's</a> leading-edge integration capabilities helped a leading global sports entertainment company automate their employee on-boarding and life cycle management by integrating ADP with Active Directory (AD) and automatically provisioning access to enterprise system based on roles and privileges:

* When a new employee starts working at any company location, their information is entered into the companyâ€™s ADP HR system.
* For new employees, RoboMQ creates identities in Active Directory and provisions them into enterprise applications based on role or security groups ensuring that each employee has a single and unique account across all systems with associated access levels.
* RoboMQ automatically generates a random password for them along with default attributes and account control settings. It then handles sending welcome or other on-boarding emails to the responsible office manager based on job role and/or location.
* For existing employees, RoboMQ updates account settings, change of roles (i.e promotions, transfer, etc.), or change of status (i.e. long term leave, termination, or re-hire).

By integrating ADP with Active Directory, significant savings result by removing the costly and tedious manual ticket processing, identity creation and access grants by system administrators. This solution also handles automatically creating tickets/cases for audit trails and provides mechanisms for alerts and notification.

Once this solution is implemented the new employee has all the accounts and application access created and he or she is ready to go from the day one!!!

Optionally, organization using Single Sign On (SSO) solutions like <a href="https://www.centrify.com/">Centrify</a> benefit from single sign on and auto provisioning.
