# Broadcast (Publish/Subscribe)

For broadcast messaging, a producer sends messages to fan-out exchange that are broadcast to all queues bound to that exchange.  As soon as a consumer subscribes to the queue, messages will be delivered to that consumer

## Python

###Prerequisites

**Python client AMQP library**

The Python library we use for this example can be found at <https://github.com/pika/pika>.  

You can install it through `sudo pip install pika`.  

Finally, import this library in your program.

```python
import pika
```

The full documentation of this library is at <a href="https://pika.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.14/" target="_blank">https://pika.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.14/</a>.

> pika library is not thread safe. Do not use a connection or channel across threads.

###Producer
The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
Set heartbeat to 60 seconds, so that client will confirm the connectivity with broker.  

```python
credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(username, password)
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host = server, port = port, virtual_host = vhost, credentials = credentials, heartbeat_interval = 60))
channel = connection.channel()
```

Then producer can publish messages to a fanout exchange where routing key is useless. It will assign a blank string to routing key in publish function.  
Delivery mode = 1 means it's a non-persistent message.

```python 
properties = pika.spec.BasicProperties(content_type = "text/plain", delivery_mode = 1)
channel.basic_publish(exchange = exchangeName, routing_key = "", body = "Hello World!", properties = properties)
```

At last, producer will disconnect with the <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

```python
connection.close()
```

###Consumer
The same as producer, consumer needs to first connect to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

Then consumer will declare a fanout exchange, a queue, and bind the queue to the exchange with any routing key (we use an empty key in this example). The routing key is useless in fanout exchange.    
Auto-delete means after all consumers have finished consuming it, the exchange or queue will be deleted by broker.  
Exclusive means no other consumer can consume the queue when this one is consuming it.  

```python
channel.exchange_declare(exchange = exchangeName, exchange_type = "fanout", auto_delete = True)
channel.queue_declare(queue = queueName, exclusive = True, auto_delete = True)
channel.queue_bind(exchange = exchangeName, queue = queueName, routing_key = None)
```

Finally, consumer can consume messages from the queue.  
The `no_ack` parameter indicates if consumer needs to explicitly send acknowledgment back to broker when it has received the message. In this example, `no_ack` equals to true, so producer does not explicitly acknowledge received messages.  
The `start_consuming()` function will be blocking the process until `stop_consuming()` is invoked or exception happens.  

```python
channel.basic_consume(consumer_callback = onMessage, queue = queueName, no_ack = True)
channel.start_consuming()
```

When messages are received, a callback function `onMessage()` will be invoked to print the message content.  

```python
def onMessage(channel, method, properties, body):
	print body
```

###Putting it all together

**producer.py**

```python
import pika
	
server = "hostname"
port = 5672
vhost = "yourvhost"
username = "username"
password = "password"
exchangeName = "testEx"
	
try:
	#connect
	credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(username, password)
	connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host = server, port = port, virtual_host = vhost, credentials = credentials, heartbeat_interval = 60))
	channel = connection.channel()
	
	#send message
	#for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
	properties = pika.spec.BasicProperties(content_type = "text/plain", delivery_mode = 1)
	channel.basic_publish(exchange = exchangeName, routing_key = "", body = "Hello World!", properties = properties)
	
	#disconnect
	connection.close()
except Exception, e:
	print e
```

**consumer.py**

```python
import pika
import time
	
server = "hostname"
port = 5672
vhost = "yourvhost"
username = "username"
password = "password"
exchangeName = "testEx"
queueName = "testQ1"
	
#callback funtion on receiving messages
def onMessage(channel, method, properties, body):
	print body
	
while True:
	try:
		#connect
		credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(username, password)
		connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host = server, port = port, virtual_host = vhost, credentials = credentials, heartbeat_interval = 60))
		channel = connection.channel()
	
		#declare exchange and queue, bind them and consume messages
		#for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
		channel.exchange_declare(exchange = exchangeName, exchange_type = "fanout", auto_delete = True)
		channel.queue_declare(queue = queueName, exclusive = True, auto_delete = True)
		channel.queue_bind(exchange = exchangeName, queue = queueName, routing_key = None)
		channel.basic_consume(consumer_callback = onMessage, queue = queueName, no_ack = True)
		channel.start_consuming()
	except Exception, e:
		#reconnect on exception
		print "Exception handled, reconnecting...\nDetail:\n%s" % e
		try:
			connection.close()
		except:
			pass
		time.sleep(5)
```

## Node.js

###Prerequisites

**Node.js client AMQP library**

The Node.js library we use for this example can be found at <https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node>.    

You can install the library through `sudo npm install amqplib`.  

Finally, require this library in your program.

```javascript
var amqp = require("amqplib");
```

The full documentation of this library is at <https://www.squaremobius.net/amqp.node/doc/channel_api.html>.

###Producer
The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
Set heartbeat to 60 seconds, so that client will confirm the connectivity with broker.  
As shown in the code, this library provides chainable callback API in the form of `.then(callback)`.  
> For the default vhost "/", you will need to insert "%2f" (its hexadecimal ASCII code) to the AMQP URI, instead of "/" itself.  

```javascript
producer = amqp.connect("amqp://" + username + ":" + password + "@" + server + ":" + port + "/" + vhost + "?heartbeat=60");
producer.then(function(conn) {
	return conn.createConfirmChannel().then(successCallback);
}).then(null, failureCallback);
```

Then producer can publish messages to a fanout exchange where routing key is useless. It will assign a blank string to routing key in publish function.  
Delivery mode = 1 means it's a non-persistent message.

```javascript
ch.publish(exchangeName, "", content = new Buffer("Hello World!"), options = {contentType: "text/plain", deliveryMode: 1},  callback);
```

At last, producer will disconnect with the <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

```javascript
conn.close();
```

###Consumer
The same as producer, consumer needs to first connect to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
The difference is that consumer uses `conn.createChannel()` function, while producer uses `conn.createConfirmChannel()` because the latter one is only useful for publish confirm.  

Then consumer will declare a fanout exchange, a queue, and bind the queue to the exchange with any routing key (we use an empty key in this example). The routing key is useless in fanout exchange.    
Durable means the exchange or queue will survive possible broker failover. It's false in this example.  
Auto-delete means after all consumers have finished consuming it, the exchange or queue will be deleted by broker.  
Exclusive means no other consumer can consume the queue when this one is consuming it.   

```javascript
ch.assertExchange(exchangeName, "fanout", {durable: false, autoDelete: true});
ch.assertQueue(queueName, {durable: false, autoDelete: true, exclusive: true});
ch.bindQueue(queueName, exchangeName, "");
```

Finally, consumer can consume messages from the queue.  
The `noAck` option indicates if consumer needs to explicitly send acknowledgment back to broker when it has received the message. In this example, `noAck` is true, so producer does not explicitly acknowledge received messages.  
The second parameter of `consume()` function is the callback on receiving messages. In this example, when messages are received, the callback function will be invoked to print the message content.  

```javascript
ch.consume(queueName, function(message) {
	console.log(message.content.toString());
}, {noAck: true});  
```

###Putting it all together

**producer.js**

```javascript
var amqp = require("amqplib");
	
var server = "hostname";
var port = "5672";
var vhost = "yourvhost";  //for "/" vhost, use "%2f" instead
var username = "username";
var password = "password";
var exchangeName = "testEx";
	
producer = amqp.connect("amqp://" + username + ":" + password + "@" + server + ":" + port + "/" + vhost + "?heartbeat=60");
producer.then(function(conn) {
	return conn.createConfirmChannel().then(function(ch) {
		//for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
		ch.publish(exchangeName, "", content = new Buffer("Hello World!"), options = {contentType: "text/plain", deliveryMode: 1}, function(err, ok) {
			if (err != null) {
				console.error("Error: failed to send message\n" + err);
			}
			conn.close();
		});
	});
}).then(null, function(err) {
	console.error(err);
});
```

**consumer.js**

```javascript
var amqp = require("amqplib");
var domain = require("domain");
	
var server = "hostname";
var port = "5672";
var vhost = "yourvhost"; //for "/" vhost, use "%2f" instead
var username = "username";
var password = "password";
var exchangeName = "testEx";
var queueName = "testQ1";
	
//use domain module to handle reconnecting
var consumer = null;
var dom = domain.create();
dom.on("error", relisten);
dom.run(listen);
	
function listen() {
	consumer = amqp.connect("amqp://" + username + ":" + password + "@" + server + ":" + port + "/" + vhost + "?heartbeat=60");
	consumer.then(function(conn) {
		return conn.createChannel().then(function(ch) {
			ch.assertExchange(exchangeName, "fanout", {durable: false, autoDelete: true});
			ch.assertQueue(queueName, {durable: false, autoDelete: true, exclusive: true});
			//for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
			ch.bindQueue(queueName, exchangeName, "");
			ch.consume(queueName, function(message) {
				//callback funtion on receiving messages
				console.log(message.content.toString());
			}, {noAck: true});
		});
	}).then(null, function(err) {
		console.error("Exception handled, reconnecting...\nDetail:\n" + err);
		setTimeout(listen, 5000);
	});
}
	
function relisten() {
	consumer.then(function(conn) {
		conn.close();
	});	
	setTimeout(listen, 5000);
}
```

## PHP

### Prerequisite

**PHP client AMQP library**

The PHP library we use for this example can be found at <https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib>.  

It uses composer to install in a few steps.  

1. Add a `composer.json` file to your project:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"videlalvaro/php-amqplib": "2.2.*"
	}
}
```

2. Download the latest composer in the same path:

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

3. Install the library through composer:

```bash
./composer.phar install
```

Finally, require this library in your program and use the classes.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php'; //directory of library folder
use PhpAmqpLib\Connection\AMQPConnection;
use PhpAmqpLib\Message\AMQPMessage;
```

###Producer
The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
Set heartbeat to 60 seconds, so that client will confirm the connectivity with broker.  

```php
$connection = new AMQPConnection($server, $port, $username, $password, $vhost, $heartbeat = 60);
$channel =  $connection->channel();
```	

Then producer can publish messages to a fanout exchange where routing key is useless. It will assign a blank string to routing key in publish function.  
Delivery mode = 1 means it's a non-persistent message.
 
```php
$message = new AMQPMessage("Hello World!", array("content_type" => "text/plain", "delivery_mode" => 1));
$channel->basic_publish($message, $exchangeName, $routing_key = "");
```

At last, producer will disconnect with the <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

```php
$connection->close();
```

###Consumer
The same as producer, consumer needs to first connect to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

Then consumer will declare a fanout exchange, a queue, and bind the queue to the exchange with any routing key (we use an empty key in this example). The routing key is useless in fanout exchange.    
Auto-delete means after all consumers have finished consuming it, the exchange or queue will be deleted by broker.  
Exclusive means no other consumer can consume the queue when this one is consuming it.  

```php
$channel->exchange_declare($exchangeName, $type = "fanout", false, false, $auto_delete = true);
$channel->queue_declare($queueName, false, false, $exclusive = true, $auto_delete = true);
$channel->queue_bind($queueName, $exchangeName, $routing_key = "");
```

Finally, consumer can consume messages from the queue.  
The `no_ack` parameter indicates if consumer needs to explicitly send acknowledgment back to broker when it has received the message. In this example, `no_ack` equals to true, so producer does not explicitly acknowledge received messages.  
The while loop will be blocking the process and listening for messages until exception happens.  

```php
$channel->basic_consume($queueName, "", false, $no_ack = true, false, false, $callback = $onMessage);

while(count($channel->callbacks)) {
	$channel->wait();
}
```

When messages are received, a callback function will be invoked to print the message content.  

```php
$onMessage = function ($message) {
	echo $message->body.PHP_EOL;
};
```

### Putting it together

**producer.php**

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php'; //directory of library folder

	$channel =  $connection->channel();	
	
	//send message
	//for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
	$message = new AMQPMessage("Hello World!", array("content_type" => "text/plain", "delivery_mode" => 1));
	$channel->basic_publish($message, $exchangeName, $routing_key = "");
	
	//disconnect
	$connection->close();

		if ($connection != null) {
			try {
				$connection->close();
			} catch (Exception $e1) {}
		}
		sleep(5);
	}
}
?>
```

## Ruby

###Prerequisites

**Ruby client AMQP library**

The Ruby library we use for this example can be found at <a href="http://rubybunny.info/" target="_blank">http://rubybunny.info/</a>.  

With Ruby version >= 2.0, you can install it through `sudo gem install bunny`.  

Finally, import this library in your program.  

```ruby
require "bunny"
```

The full documentation of this library is at <a href="http://rubybunny.info/articles/guides.html" target="_blank">http://rubybunny.info/articles/guides.html</a>.

> We recommend combining the documentation with the source code of this library when you use it because some of the documentation out there is not being updated timely from our observation.  

###Producer
The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
Set heartbeat to 60 seconds, so that client will confirm the connectivity with broker.  
Although the library provides a connection property named `recover_from_connection_close`, we discourage you to use it. The reason will be explained in the Consumer section.  

```ruby
connection = Bunny.new(:host => server, :port => port, :vhost => vhost, :user => username, :pass => password, :heartbeat => 60, :recover_from_connection_close => false)
connection.start
channel = connection.create_channel
```

Then producer can publish messages to a fanout exchange where routing key is useless.  
Delivery mode = 1 means it's a non-persistent message.

```ruby 
exchange = channel.fanout(exchangeName, :auto_delete => true)
exchange.publish("Hello World!", :content_type => "text/plain", :delivery_mode => 1)
```

At last, producer will disconnect with the <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

```ruby
connection.close
```

###Consumer
The same as producer, consumer needs to first connect to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

Then consumer will declare a fanout exchange, a queue, and bind the queue to the exchange without any routing key since routing key is useless in fanout exchange.    
Auto-delete means after all consumers have finished consuming it, the exchange or queue will be deleted by broker.  
Exclusive means no other consumer can consume the queue when this one is consuming it.  

```ruby
exchange = channel.fanout(exchangeName, :auto_delete => true)
queue = channel.queue(queueName, :exclusive => true, :auto_delete => true)
queue.bind(exchange)
```

After that, consumer can consume messages from the queue.  
The `manual_ack` parameter indicates if consumer needs to manually send acknowledgment back to broker when it has received the message. In this example, `manual_ack` equals to false, so producer does not manually acknowledge received messages.  
The `subscribe()` function is followed by a callback which will be invoked to print the message payload on receiving a message.  

```ruby
queue.subscribe(:block => false, :manual_ack => false) do |delivery_info, metadata, payload|
  puts payload
end
```

As we mentioned in the Producer section, `recover_from_connection_close` is set to false when connecting to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker. It matters for consumers because `recover_from_connection_close` will only recover the connection, it won't recreate exchange and queue in case they are gone. Therefore, a more robust approach is  letting your code handle reconnecting on its own and keep checking the existence of the subscribed queue.  

```ruby
while true
  raise "Lost the subscribed queue %s" % queueName unless connection.queue_exists?(queueName)
  sleep 1
end
```

###Putting it all together

**producer.rb**

```ruby
require "bunny"

server = "hostname"
port = 5672
vhost = "yourvhost"
username = "username"
password = "password"
exchangeName = "testEx"

begin
  #connect
  connection = Bunny.new(:host => server, :port => port, :vhost => vhost, :user => username, :pass => password, :heartbeat => 60, :recover_from_connection_close => false)
  connection.start
  channel = connection.create_channel

  #send message
  #for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
  exchange = channel.fanout(exchangeName, :auto_delete => true)
  exchange.publish("Hello World!", :content_type => "text/plain", :delivery_mode => 1)

  #disconnect
  connection.close
rescue Exception => e
  puts e
end
```

**consumer.rb**

```ruby
require "bunny"

server = "hostname"
port = 5672
vhost = "yourvhost"
username = "username"
password = "password"
exchangeName = "testEx"
queueName = "testQ1"

while true
  begin
    #connect, disable auto-reconnect so as to manually reconnect
    connection = Bunny.new(:host => server, :port => port, :vhost => vhost, :user => username, :pass => password, :heartbeat => 60, :recover_from_connection_close => false)
    connection.start
    channel = connection.create_channel

    #declare exchange and queue, bind them and consume messages
    #for fanout type exchange, routing key is useless
    exchange = channel.fanout(exchangeName, :auto_delete => true)
    queue = channel.queue(queueName, :exclusive => true, :auto_delete => true)
    queue.bind(exchange)
    queue.subscribe(:block => false, :manual_ack => false) do |delivery_info, metadata, payload|
      puts payload
    end
    #keep checking the existence of the subscribed queue
    while true
      raise "Lost the subscribed queue %s" % queueName unless connection.queue_exists?(queueName)
      sleep 1
    end
  rescue Exception => e
    #reconnect on exception
    puts "Exception handled, reconnecting...\nDetail:\n%s" % e
    #blindly clean old connection
    begin
      connection.close
    end
    sleep 5
  end
end
```

## Java

### Prerequisites

**Java client AMQP library**

The Java library we use for this example can be found at <https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html>.  

Download the library jar file, then import this library in your program `import com.rabbitmq.client.*;` and compile your source code with the jar file. For example,  

```bash
javac -cp ".:./rabbitmq-client.jar" Producer.java Consumer.java 
```

Run the producer and consumer classes. For example,  

```bash
java -cp ".:./rabbitmq-client.jar" Consumer
java -cp ".:./rabbitmq-client.jar" Producer
```

Of course, you can eventually compress your producer and consumer classes into jar files.

###Producer
The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
Set heartbeat to 60 seconds, so that client will confirm the connectivity with broker.  

```java
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
factory.setHost(server);
factory.setPort(port);
factory.setVirtualHost(vhost);
factory.setUsername(username);
factory.setPassword(password);
factory.setRequestedHeartbeat(60);
connection = factory.newConnection();
channel = connection.createChannel();
```

Then producer can publish messages to a fanout exchange where routing key is useless. It will assign a blank string to routing key in publish function.  

```java 
String message = "Hello World!";
channel.basicPublish(exchangeName, "", MessageProperties.TEXT_PLAIN, message.getBytes());
```

At last, producer will disconnect with the <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

```java
connection.close();
```

###Consumer
The same as producer, consumer needs to first connect to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

Then consumer will declare a fanout exchange, a queue, and bind the queue to the exchange with any routing key (we use an empty key in this example). The routing key is useless in fanout exchange.    
The fourth parameter of `exchangeDeclare()` and `queueDeclare()` are auto-delete. That means after all consumers have finished consuming it, the exchange or queue will be deleted by broker.  
The third parameter of `queueDeclare()` is exclusive. That means no other consumer can consume the queue when this one is consuming it.  

```java
channel.exchangeDeclare(exchangeName, "fanout", false, true, false, null);
channel.queueDeclare(queueName, false, true, true, null);
channel.queueBind(queueName, exchangeName, "", null);
```

Finally, consumer can consume messages from the queue.  
The second parameter of `basicConsume()` function no-ack indicates if consumer needs to explicitly send acknowledgment back to broker when it has received the message. In this example, no-ack equals to true, so producer does not explicitly acknowledge received messages.  
The while loop will be blocking the process and listening for messages until exception happens. When messages are received, it will print the message content.  

```java
QueueingConsumer qc = new QueueingConsumer(channel);
channel.basicConsume(queueName, true, qc);
while (true) {
	QueueingConsumer.Delivery delivery = qc.nextDelivery();
	String message = new String(delivery.getBody());
	System.out.println(message);
}
```

## Go

###Prerequisites

**Go client AMQP library**

The Go library we use for this example can be found at <a href="https://github.com/streadway/amqp" target="_blank">https://github.com/streadway/amqp</a>.  

You can install it through `go get github.com/streadway/amqp`.  

Finally, import this library in your program.  

```go
import "github.com/streadway/amqp"
```

The full documentation of this library is at <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/streadway/amqp" target="_blank">https://godoc.org/github.com/streadway/amqp</a>.  

###Producer
The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  
Set heartbeat to 60 seconds, so that client will confirm the connectivity with broker.  

```go
connection, err := amqp.DialConfig(fmt.Sprintf("amqp://%s:%s@%s:%d/%s", username, password, server, port, vhost), amqp.Config{Heartbeat: 60 * time.Second})
channel, err := connection.Channel()
```

Then producer can publish messages to a fanout exchange where routing key is useless. It will assign a blank string to routing key in publish function.  
Delivery mode = 1 means it's a non-persistent message.  

```go 
err = channel.Publish(exchangeName, "", false, false, amqp.Publishing{ContentType:  "text/plain", DeliveryMode: 1, Body: []byte("Hello World!")})
```

At last, producer will disconnect with the <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

```go
connection.Close()
```

###Consumer
The same as producer, consumer needs to first connect to <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> broker.  

Then consumer will declare a fanout exchange, a queue, and bind the queue to the exchange with any routing key (we use an empty key in this example). The routing key is useless in fanout exchange.  
Durable means the exchange or queue will survive possible broker failover. It's false in this example.  
Auto-delete means after all consumers have finished consuming it, the exchange or queue will be deleted by broker.  
Exclusive means no other consumer can consume the queue when this one is consuming it.  

```go
// audo-delete = true
err = channel.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, "fanout", false, true, false, false, nil)

// durable = false; auto-delete = true; exclusive = true
queue, err := channel.QueueDeclare(queueName, false, true, true, false, nil)

err = channel.QueueBind(queueName, "", exchangeName, false, nil)
```

Finally, consumer can consume messages from the queue.  
Consumer-tag can be later used to `Cancel()` this consumer when it's no longer needed.  
Auto-ack parameter indicates if consumer needs to explicitly send acknowledgment back to broker when it has received the message. In this example, auto-ack equals to true, so producer does not explicitly acknowledge received messages.  

```go
// consumer-tag = "consumer"; auto-ack = true
messageChan, err := channel.Consume(queue.Name, "consumer", true, true, false, false, nil)
```

Note a message channel is returned by the `Consume()` function. Incoming messages will be received through that channel.  

> Channel in Golang is a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values. Sends and receives block until the other side is ready.  

```go
for message := range messageChan {
	fmt.Println(string(message.Body))
}
```

###Putting it all together

## C
### Prerequisites

**C client AMQP library**

robomq.io is built on AMQP, an open, general-purpose protocol for messaging. There are a number of clients for AMQP in many different languages.  However, we'll choose a simple C-language AMQP client library written for use with v2.0+ of the RabbitMQ broker.

<a href="https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/tree/master/librabbitmq" target="_blank">https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/tree/master/librabbitmq</a>

You can copy librabbitmq subfolder from latest release located here on GitHub:

[https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c) <a href="https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c" target="_blank">https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c</a>

Alternatively, thanks to Subversion support in GitHub, you can use svn export directly:

```bash
svn export https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/trunk/librabbitmq
```

Copy the librabbitmq package into your working directory:

```bash
cp librabbitmq ./
```

Also copy all source files and Makefile from <a href="https://www.robomq.io" target="_blank">RoboMQ</a> SDK at <https://github.com/robomq/robomq.io/tree/master/sdk/AMQP/C> into the same directory.  

Now your working directory should have the content as bellow:  
*broadcast*  config.h  *librabbitmq*  Makefile  *one-to-one*  *request-reply*  *routing-key* *topic*

Use the Makefile to compile under a Linux terminal.  

* Run `make type={sub-directory}` to compile the producer and consumer under the sub-directory.  
* Before compiling the next sub-directory, run `make clean` to clean up the compiled files.	 

Note that these examples provide a simple client implementation to get started but does not go into detailed description of all flags passed into the AMQP methods. 
A complete reference to RabbitMQ's implementaton of version 0-9-1 of the AMQP specification can be found in this guide.
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html" target="_blank">https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html</a>


### Producer
For broadcast messaging, the producer should publish messages to the the **fanout** type exchange that broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues bound to it.  Therefore, routing_key is not required in this example.

```c
amqp_basic_properties_t props;
props._flags = AMQP_BASIC_CONTENT_TYPE_FLAG | AMQP_BASIC_DELIVERY_MODE_FLAG;
props.content_type = amqp_cstring_bytes("text/plain");
props.delivery_mode = 1; /* non-persistent delivery mode */
amqp_boolean_t mandatory = 0;
amqp_boolean_t immediate = 0;
char exchange_name[] = "fanout-exchange";
char routing_key[] = "";
int result;
	
// Sending message
result = amqp_basic_publish(conn,
		channel,
		amqp_cstring_bytes(exchange_name),
		amqp_cstring_bytes(routing_key),
		mandatory,
		immediate,
		&props,
		amqp_cstring_bytes("Hello"));
```

### Consumer
Then the consumer should create an exchange and subscribe to a queue.  This exchange will be defined similarly to the one-to-one example, however, the **fanout** exchange type is specified below as **exchange_type** and binding_key is not required.

```c
amqp_bytes_t queue;
amqp_channel_t channel = 1;
amqp_boolean_t passive = 0;
amqp_boolean_t durable = 0;
amqp_boolean_t exclusive = 0;
amqp_boolean_t auto_delete = 1;
amqp_boolean_t internal = 0;
char exchange_name[] = "fanout-exchange";
char exchange_type[] = "fanout";
char queue_name[] = "hello-queue";
char binding_key[] = "";
	
// Declaring exchange
amqp_exchange_declare(conn, channel, amqp_cstring_bytes(exchange_name), amqp_cstring_bytes(exchange_type),
		passive, durable, auto_delete, internal, amqp_empty_table);
	
// Declaring queue
amqp_queue_declare_ok_t *r = amqp_queue_declare(conn, channel, amqp_cstring_bytes(queue_name),
		passive, durable, exclusive, auto_delete, amqp_empty_table);

queue = amqp_bytes_malloc_dup(r->queue);
	
// Binding to queue
amqp_queue_bind(conn, channel, queue, amqp_cstring_bytes(exchange_name), amqp_cstring_bytes(binding_key),
		amqp_empty_table);
```

At this point, consumer should start consuming messages broadcast from the **fanout** exchange type.

### Putting it all together
The full code below includes some basic AMQP error handling for consumer that is useful when declaring exchanges and queues.  In addition, main receiver loop attempts to reconnect upon network connection failure.

    return conn;

    props.content_type = amqp_cstring_bytes("text/plain");
    props.delivery_mode = 1; /* non-persistent delivery mode */
    amqp_boolean_t mandatory = 0;
    amqp_boolean_t immediate = 0;
    char exchange_name[] = "fanout-exchange";
    char routing_key[] = "";

    int result;
	
    conn = mqconnect();
